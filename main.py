# Project 4
# Coin Toss Game
# Goal: Create a simple game that will flip a coin randomly.
#       If user picks the same side as the program, they win.


# This is your main function
# Main is the start of your program
# Use this to run the sequence of functions we
# need to complete this project.
def main():


# Print to user to pick
# Returns 0 for heads or 1 for tails
def prompt_user():


# Randomly pick heads or tails
# Returns 0 for heads or 1 for tails
def flip_coin():


# This function returns a boolean
# Returns true for a win and false for a loss
def evaluate_game(user_input, random_input):


# Run this file if it's the main file
# We will find out the reason for this later
